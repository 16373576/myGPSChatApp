When the application is opened, a menu with three buttons are displayed. The first button opens an activity where the user can input a message in a text field and press a button to submit a message. There is a back button to the previous activity. This activity also detects the GPS location and hold this location until the user submits a message to the server with the location. The second button opens an activity where a map is displayed with all the messages available as markers on the map. The third button displays a text view with all messages currently on the server displayed. In addition, new messages that are submitted within 10 meters of an existing message are appended to the existing message.
